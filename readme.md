# Card Decks for Easy Game Moderation

Each of these are just small JavaScript scripts that generate cards at random from a deck.

## [Diamant](https://mythreyiramesh.github.io/card-decks/diamant) 
This is a push your luck game. Game set up needs pen/paper for the mod. Base game has five rounds. No artifacts are included.

## [Fall of Lanka](https://mythreyiramesh.github.io/card-decks/fall-of-lanka)
This is inspired by Diamant (above), but has a different theme with a modified deck. Three rounds have increasing number of precious items and dangers.
